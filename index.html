						CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
						physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment
						at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
						venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
					</p>
					<p>
						He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
						particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he
						discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A
						potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could
						have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a
						repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed
						of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
					</p>
					<p>
						If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the
						heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped
						mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
						irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be
						diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
					</p>
					<p>
						“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page
						and drew a double box around it. <br />
						On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported
						that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his
						hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
					</p>
					<p>
						Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to
						<a href="#">the first sliver of cosmic time </a>with telescopes at
						the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the
						Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the
						fabric of space-time — so-called
						<a
							href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/12/science/ligo-gravitational-waves-black-holes-einstein.html"
							>gravitational waves </a
						>— the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when
						it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a
						second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of
						inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth
						was correct.

						Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though
						many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
					</p>
					<p>
						If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in
						science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing
						the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast
						realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
						<br />Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see,
						extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of
						billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger
						cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover,
						beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of other
						universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water
						boiling over.
					</p>
					<h3>‘As Big as It Gets’</h3>
					<p>
						In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces
						operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle
						accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself.
						Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of
						gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of
						general relativity, should ruffle space-time. <br />
						Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe
						expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big as
						it gets.” <br />
						He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe,
						sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.” <br />
						The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath
						of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture
						of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the
						surface of the sun. <br />
						Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as
						Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization,
						reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for
						Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The
						Astrophysical Journal.
